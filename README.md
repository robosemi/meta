## Memo for Editors

This section describes how to preview new pages on Ubuntu.

### Setting up

```bash
sudo apt install ruby-dev
git clone https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman
cd cayman
./script/bootstrap
```
The last command sometimes needs the root permission.
After that, execute the following commands:
```bash
cd ${root of this repo.}
sudo bundle install
```

### Previewing

Execute the following command on the root of this repo.
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
Then visiting [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/) in your browser, you can preview pages locally.

## Aknowledgement

This site is based on the [Cayman](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman) theme.
